# FCC-Choropleth-Map

This was put together for the Data Visualization course on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc21752981-84f1-47db-a786-eea26f47141e/data-visualization). The aim was to create a visualization of the prevalence of bachelor degrees. The website used D3.js to build the visualization.

A demo can be found [here](https://normanrichardson.github.io/FCC-Choropleth-Map/). The unit tests can be run by selecting the "hamburger menu" in the top left and selecting the "D3: choropleth" option.
