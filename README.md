# [FCC-Choropleth-Map](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map)

This was put together for the Data Visualization course on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/). The aim was to create a choropleth map visualization of the prevalence of bachelor degrees. The application uses D3.js to build the visualization.
